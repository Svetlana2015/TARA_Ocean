# TARA_Oceans

This practical session introduces methods for analyzing microbial diversity from metagenomic
sequencing data obtained by the Tara Oceans project. The main objective was to characterize
and compare the microbial diversity between surface and mesopelagic water samples collected
from two oceans - the North Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.
Starting from raw sequencing reads, we extracted 16S/18S rRNA gene fragments, widely used as
phylogenetic markers, to assess the composition and diversity of marine microbial communities.
Through a series of steps including read quality control, filtering, and clustering into Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs), we computed several alpha- and beta-diversity indices to evaluate
species richness and community similarity across environments. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis
based on taxonomic annotation allowed us to identify the main taxa present in the samples.
This practical session is part of a better understanding of the diversity and structure of marine
microbial communities in relation to environmental conditions such as depth, oceanic region,
light availability, and nutrient concentration.
